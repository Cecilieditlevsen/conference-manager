## Technologies used

The project utilizes the following technologies:

`Vite` Vite is a fast and lightweight build tool that optimizes the development experience for modern web applications. It enables quick bundling and reloading of modules, resulting in shorter build times and faster development cycles.

`React Query`  To handle data-fetching and state management. 

`Twind` To facilitate a utility-first and component-based approach. A CSS-IN-JS tool to make the react component integrate more seamlessly 

`TypeScript` To enhance code maintainability and reliability



## Project Overview

The main focus of this project was to develop a comprehensive React component that seamlessly integrates into an existing vanilla JavaScript/HTML project. It was specifically designed to meet the requirements of a commune that wanted a conference listing page with filtering options.

The primary objective was to create a highly functional React component that could be effortlessly embedded within the larger vanilla JavaScript/HTML project. This component serves as a self-contained module responsible for presenting a dynamic list of conferences in the commune's area, along with intuitive filtering capabilities.

To ensure a cohesive user experience and consistency with the existing design system of the vanilla project, the React component's styles were meticulously crafted using Twind, a css-in-js tool. By leveraging shared variable names and excluding a preflight (CSS normalize), the component's styles seamlessly blend with the overall aesthetics of the vanilla JavaScript project.

Furthermore, the React component was implemented using React Aria Components, prioritizing web accessibility and adherence to accessibility best practices. This guarantees an inclusive and user-friendly experience.
